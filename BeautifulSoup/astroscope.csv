8|It may annoy you that certain people are getting emotionally worked up about something that does not mean much to you, but try to see the situation from their point of view. It could be they have a lot more to lose, so maybe show some sympathy?|leo|04-28-2020

10|As usual you have taken on too much work and, as usual, you are now wishing you had learned the art of saying “no”. Order your tasks in terms of importance and work through them one by one. In the meantime, don’t agree to do anything more!|virgo|04-28-2020
